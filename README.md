Auteurly is a professional networking platform designed to connect the fragmented community of film professionals in Rwanda's nascent film industry, "Hillywood." It provides a centralized, verifiable, and searchable registry to replace informal, word-of-mouth hiring with a transparent, merit-based system. The platform aims to enhance the visibility of local talent, foster collaboration, and attract international productions by providing the foundational infrastructure for a more formal and equitable creative ecosystem.
